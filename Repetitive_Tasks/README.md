The example scripts present in this repository automate repetitive tasks such as:

- [pdf_to_mp3.py](pdf_to_mp3.py): Converts a pdf file to a mp3 audio file.
- [telemarketing-gui-for-data-entry.py](telemarketing-gui-for-data-entry.py): Script to create a pop-window to entry 
data collected by banking telemarketers. The script initiates a data entry window and saves the collected data to a
.xlsx file upon submission. After each submission the data on the pop-window is cleared to avoid having to re-start 
the script.
