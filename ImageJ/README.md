### Image Analysis Automation with Fiji
This sub-project aims to explore the automation of image analysis tasks using Fiji (Image J). Fiji is a open-source platform widely used for processing and analyzing scientific images.

Two scripts are provided as examples:

- [Max Intensity Projection Script](Max_Intensity_Image_Processing.ijm): This script iterates through a collection of Z-stack images and saves them as maximum intensity projections.

- [Cell Counting Script](Auto-Threshold-Cell-Count.ijm): This script processes images to identify and count cells based on thresholding techniques.

### Credits
The scripts included in this project are based on the tutorial ["Image Analysis Program"]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4URnGkrxXP0)) by Luke Hammond, Director of Cellular Imaging at the Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University. Original scripts can be found on the [Luke Hammond's GitHub](https://github.com/lahammond/CI_ImageAnalysisProgram/tree/main).
