# PyMOL Scripting

This project briefly explores PyMOL scripting for analysis, visualization and image rendering. The [heme_group_environment.pml](heme_group_environment.pml) contains a command-based script to create a reproducible visualization of human oxyhemoglobin's heme group and its surrounding environment. 
The results can be observed through [heme_group_env.png](heme_group_env.png).
This activity was guided through [Reed's College](https://people.reed.edu/~glasfeld/pretty/) and [ComsChems](https://www.compchems.com/scripting-in-PyMOL-a-comprehensive-guide-for-beginners/#why-scripting-in-PyMOL) PyMOL visualization and scripting guides.
